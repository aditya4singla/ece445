# Aditya's Lab Notebook

## 2/8/2022 - First TA Meeting 
We talked roughly about how this project will shape up. Daniel mentioned the following things:
- How to design the PCB: We will mostly follow the steps outlined in the CAD assignment, but instead import the components required for our particular project.
- The initial PCB order will be somewhere in March, and we must have a keycad file ready for review before then.
- The demo will be graded based on the RV tables for each subsytem, along with our high level requirements. 
- The high level requirements must be YES/NO items which can be tested. 
- RV tables outline the requirement, and how it would be tested, for example stepping down voltage to 3.3 V
- We should look at our components first (such as the laser, motor, gps), and then find a suitable microncontroller which is compatible with them.

Our action items for the next meeting are:
- Complete the proposal
- Do more research on what specific components to order
- Flesh out the project, and exactly what each subsystem should look like.
