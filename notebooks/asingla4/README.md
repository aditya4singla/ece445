# Aditya's Lab Notebook

## 2/8/2022 - First TA Meeting 
We talked roughly about how this project will shape up. Daniel mentioned the following things:
- How to design the PCB: We will mostly follow the steps outlined in the CAD assignment, but instead import the components required for our particular project.
- The initial PCB order will be somewhere in March, and we must have a keycad file ready for review before then.
- The demo will be graded based on the RV tables for each subsytem, along with our high level requirements. 
- The high level requirements must be YES/NO items which can be tested. 
- RV tables outline the requirement, and how it would be tested, for example stepping down voltage to 3.3 V
- We should look at our components first (such as the laser, motor, gps), and then find a suitable microncontroller which is compatible with them.

Our action items for the next meeting are:
- Complete the proposal
- Do more research on what specific components to order
- Flesh out the project, and exactly what each subsystem should look like.

## 2/18/2022 - Soldering Assignment
We met in the senior design lab to work on the soldering assignment. Today we were able to get the soldering part of the assignment done, leaving the software component for next week.

## 2/19/2022 - Team Meeting 1
We met to work on fixing our proposal based on the feedback given to us regarding formatting. We fixed most issues and resubmitted the proposal.

## 2/20/2022 - Team Meeting 2
We met and worked on the design document for the DDC presentation tomorrow. We were able to get all our content ready for the check presentation.

## 2/21/2022 - DDC
We had our DDC check meeting today. Some of the feedback given to us was:
- We need to fix our 3rd high level requirement, more specifically giving more details about the increment in target pace through the buttons.
- We need to add data protocols into our block diagram, as well as mentioning the exact voltage going to each component. He also mentioned that we should remove the exact component names from our document to give us some more flexibility on that front.
- In the RV tables we must add some tolerance for the resistor as well. We should also fix formatting (move to 1A, 1B, from just 1)
- In the tolerance analysis we need to be more specific, especially add the angles that the servo motor will work on.
- For safety and ethics, we should pad this section a bit more and really stress on the important ethical issue of privacy, etc.
